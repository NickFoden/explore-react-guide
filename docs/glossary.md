## Components

- **components** are the building blocks of React that allow various parts of a User Interace (UI) to be split up. They are JavaScript functions that return React elements that appear in the virtual DOM and UI.

## Props

- **props** are variables explicitly passed to a component.

## State

- **state** is used to refer to variables set internally within a component.
